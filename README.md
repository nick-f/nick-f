## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer and Mac admin.

In my day job I primarily write Ruby code and bash scripts, so you'll see a lot of that here.

Currently I'm working on making some of the scripts and helpers I've created available to pay it forward.

Check out:
- 🍎 [axm](https://github.com/nick-f/axm), a Ruby gem for interacting with the Apple Business/School Manager APIs
- 💁 [okta-update-attributes.rb](https://github.com/nick-f/okta-update-attributes.rb), a Ruby script to bulk update Okta profiles from a CSV
- 💻 [mac-admin](https://github.com/nick-f/mac-admin), a smattering of scripts that don't fit anywhere else
